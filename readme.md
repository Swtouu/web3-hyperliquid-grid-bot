Setup lib
1. pip install hyperliquid-python-sdk

To set up grid trading on the Hyperliquid DApp, you need to first generate an API key from the Hyperliquid platform.
Then, provide the key in `eth_account.Account.from_key("")` and input your address (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby Wallet, etc.) in the address field for trading.  

If you want to learn more about the package, please check out [Hyperliquid API documentation](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api) 
and see examples on [Hyperliquid GitHub](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk).

Thanks to @timebaseline for the grid strategy.
